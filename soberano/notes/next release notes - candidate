v2.0.11 Candidate release

New: 

Fix: Sending printer paper cutting command from TCPTOOL was disabled. Cutting must be controlled by means of the OS printer settings tool. 

Fix: In fast ordering window (based on product icons), some items were wrongly selected in the item-to-order autocompletion combobox.
	It was due to when pushing product button (icon), the combobox text was filled out only with the product name without the 
	corresponding inventory item code, so the ambiguity between comboitems upon selection.

Fix: Avoid division by zero. These lines were corrected:

	In FUNCTION soberano."fn_ProcessRun_close"(processrunid integer,
												outputitems character varying[],
												outputquantities numeric[],
												outputunits integer[],
												weights integer[],
												loginname character varying)
												
		Line SET "Value" = "Value" + outputsTotalValue * weighttoredistribute / producedoutputcount / 100
		
		was replaced by SET "Value" = "Value" + CASE WHEN producedoutputcount = 0 THEN 0
													ELSE outputsTotalValue * weighttoredistribute / producedoutputcount / 100 END
												
	In FUNCTION soberano."fn_Stock_change"(stockchangeid integer)
	
		Line SET "Value" = "Value" + outputsTotalValue * weighttoredistribute / producedoutputcount / 100
		
		was replaced by SET "Value" = "Value" + CASE WHEN producedoutputcount = 0 THEN 0
													ELSE outputsTotalValue * weighttoredistribute / producedoutputcount / 100 END
