v2.0.10 La Lisa Edition

New: FUNCTION soberano."fn_Product_get"(productid character varying, loginname character varying).
	This is required by the order's form product barcode processing code. Noticed instead the product
	integer id, it takes the string inventory item id as parameter.
	
New: In order recording form (new_order.zul), if only one counter is configured and it's not selected, 
	the order is still allocated to it.

Fix: Removed EAN-8 barcodes processing.

Fix: Corrections of barcode processing in ItemToOrderComboboxComposer.cmbItemToOrder_onChanging(Event) and
	OrderManagementComposer.btnMake_onClick()
	
Fix: Bad calculation of process run output values. These lines were corrected:

	In FUNCTION soberano."fn_ProcessRun_close"(processrunid integer,
												outputitems character varying[],
												outputquantities numeric[],
												outputunits integer[],
												weights integer[],
												loginname character varying)
												
		Line outputvalue := outputquantities[i] * outputsTotalValue * weights[i] / 100;
		
		was replaced by outputvalue := outputsTotalValue * weights[i] / 100;
		
		And line SET "Value" = "Value" + pro."Quantity" * outputsTotalValue * weighttoredistribute / producedoutputcount / 100
		
		was replaced by SET "Value" = "Value" + outputsTotalValue * weighttoredistribute / producedoutputcount / 100
												
	In FUNCTION soberano."fn_Stock_change"(stockchangeid integer)
	
		Line outputvalue := itemRecord.quantity * outputsTotalValue * itemRecord.weight / 100;
		
		was replaced by outputvalue := outputsTotalValue * itemRecord.weight / 100;
		
		And line SET "Value" = "Value" + pro."Quantity" * outputsTotalValue * weighttoredistribute / producedoutputcount / 100
		
		was replaced by SET "Value" = "Value" + outputsTotalValue * weighttoredistribute / producedoutputcount / 100	
		
	Unit test cases were updated accordingly.
