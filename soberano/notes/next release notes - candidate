v1.0.4 release

New: Concept "Process 1 is a subprocess of Process 2" added to conceptual model, playing Process 1 the role of Subprocess.
	Each time a Process 2's process run is executed r times, a number of Process1's runs equal to r are also executed as
	part of the same transaction.
	
	Subprocesses are only executed when closing order's process runs. So, configured subprocesses of a process not connected
	to an order aren't executed (just ignored).
	
	It's assumed a subprocess is a product's process. Otherwise, the inventory couldn't be properly updated.
	
	The purpose of subprocesses is to save time by avoiding repetitive configuration tasks. This is achieved by sharing 
	subprocesses among many product (non acquirable) processes whose recipes (inputs) often change in time. For example:
	beer / run / tequila / ... brands used in cocktails and garnish ingredients.
	
	In Michelada recipe, instead of using Cristal Beer or Bucanero Beer as input, it would be used just Beer as subprocess.
	There would be the product Beer configured, with the corresponding process having the correct beer as input. It wouldn't 
	be required to change all the beer based cocktail recipes any time the available beer changes. Instead, only the process
	Beer is required to be modified.
	
Fix: In the payment processor modal window, the amount to collect is rounded up (with a precision of 8 decimal places). Before,
	it was rounded half even, causing inconveniences with high precision exchange rates.
