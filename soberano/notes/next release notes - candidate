1.0.3

New: Concept OpenShift added to conceptual model.

New: Now, as a condition to create an order, it's explicitly required to open a shift. The current day or tomorrow day
	shift can be opened. A day can be open only once and will remain in that state forever. Another condition to create an
	order is that current day or tomorrow day shift has not been closed. For the second condition to be met, a closure
	can be canceled. 

New: When the option 'First order on current shift requires a previous cash operation.' is unchecked, the cash register is
	emptied upon the creation of the first order of the shift by means of automatic withdrawals executed by soberano.user.top 
	(superuser). Otherwise, it's required a cash register operation (deposit, withdrawal, balancing) to be executed by a user.

New: It was removed the function to migrate data from SYSCOOP-gastro DB to Soberano DB.

Fix: A bug in soberano."fn_InventoryOperation_getSPI"(shiftdatestr character varying, warehouseid integer,
	acquirablematerialid integer, lang character, loginname character varying) made wrong values were returned
	for future days when the current day was already closed.
