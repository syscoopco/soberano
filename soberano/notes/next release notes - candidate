v2.0.4 candidate

New: Shift closure general report, full report, cash register report, and cost center report queries were updated (simplified).

Fix: In shift closure reports, sales amounts didn't take into account surcharges. This was corrected.

Fix: Subprocesses were shown in shift closure reports. Corrected.

Fix: Errors in functions soberano."fn_Order_make"(orderid integer, itemid integer, description character varying, runs numeric, loginname character varying),
		and soberano."fn_Order_changeDeliveryProvider"(orderid integer, providerid integer, loginname character varying),
		caused bad calculation and presentation in tickets of reseller compensated prices. The right statement was:
	
	--set compensated prices
	UPDATE soberano."ProcessRunOutputHasPriceForOrder"

		SET "Price" = "Price" * (100  + deliveryProviderRate) / 100
			WHERE "ProcessRunHasProcessRunId" = processRunId;
			
	Other corrections in ticket soberano."fn_Order_getTicket"(orderid integer, receivedamount numeric, change numeric, lang character, loginname character varying)
