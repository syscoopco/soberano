v2.0.0 release

New: Web application upgraded from Java 11 to Java 17.

New: javax (J2EE) namespace replaced by jakarta (Jakarta). 

New: Spring upgraded from 5 to 6 version.

New: ZK upgraded to 10.1.0.

New: System enhanced with Tomcat 10, which is now required.

Fix: In Spring application context configuration file (applicationContext.xml), added this line:
	
	<security:intercept-url pattern="/zkau/view/**" access="isFullyAuthenticated()"/>
	
	This is required by ZK 10.1.0 for delivering image contents dynamically configured (not image source urls).
	For example, product and product category button icons.
