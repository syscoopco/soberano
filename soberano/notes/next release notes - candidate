1.0.1

New: shift_closures.zul now shows canceled closures too.

New: A new decision was added to check canceled shift closures in table "metamodel"."ResponsibilityFilter"

Fix: Auditor responsibility was able to record and cancel a shift closure. These rights were removed from table "metamodel"."ResponsibilityFilter"

Minor correction: 

Typo: User manual, page 102: “las existencia” replaced by “las existencias”.
