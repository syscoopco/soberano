v2.0.1 candidate

New: Preferred ZK theme changed to breeze.

New: Created new index on the largest table:

	CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS index18
	    ON metamodel."Vote" USING btree
	    ("This_is_on_Timestamp" ASC NULLS LAST)
	    WITH (deduplicate_items=True)
	    TABLESPACE pg_default;
	    
New: Shift closure full and cost center reports can now be exported to a csv file.

Fix: PSQL functions fn_ProcessRun_getReport, soberano."fn_ProcessRun_getInputs" and soberano."fn_ProcessRun_getOutputs" optimized for
	fast rows retrieval.
	
Fix: The following line was added to Spring context XML configuration file, to allow button decorating fonts to be loaded
	(for example, in grid, move next, move previous, move last and move first buttons):

	<security:intercept-url pattern="/zkau/web/**/zul/less/font/**" method="GET" access="permitAll()"/>
	
	It has to do with migration to ZK 10.1.0.
	
Fix: In process_runs.zul, a java.lang.NullPointerException was thrown due to in that page subprocess components are not included.
	So, a try catch block without handling code was added enclosing the proper code fragment.

User manual: No changes.
