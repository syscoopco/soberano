v2.0.4 release

New: Migration to ZK Framework 10.2.1.

New: Shift closure general / full / cash register / and cost center report printed outputs are simplified.

New: Report exporting is externalized by means of zul component custom attributes, for static report parameters, 
	and spring beans, for retrieving data from database and creating files in the target format (csv, xlsx, ...).
	Dynamic parameters, like date ranges, depend on the form (page) from the report is requested.

Fix: In some shift closure reports, sales amounts didn't take into account surcharges. This was corrected.

Fix: Subprocesses were shown in some shift closure reports. Corrected.

Fix: Errors related to reseller price compensation were fixed in the following functions:

		FUNCTION soberano."fn_Order_make"(orderid integer, itemid integer, description character varying, 
								runs numeric, loginname character varying),
		
		FUNCTION soberano."fn_Order_changeDeliveryProvider"(orderid integer, providerid integer, 
							loginname character varying),
		caused bad calculation and presentation in tickets of reseller compensated prices. The right statement was:
	
	Right query fragment: UPDATE soberano."ProcessRunOutputHasPriceForOrder"
							SET "Price" = "Price" * (100  + deliveryProviderRate) / 100
								WHERE ...
			
	Correction in FUNCTION soberano."fn_Order_getTicket"(orderid integer, receivedamount numeric, change numeric, 
														lang character, loginname character varying)
	
	When reseller price compensation is enabled, the shown delivery fee must be based on the list prices (before 
	compensation). That's the money to be given to the reseller, as commission over those prices.
