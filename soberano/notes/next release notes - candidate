v2.0.5 release candidate

New: Now, both, a default customer and a delivery provider can be set to a counter. Upon order creation, only if none 
	is specified, defaults are used. This is useful in case the business is selling through an intermediary provider 
	(aka a reseller) that doesn't disclose customer data. Still, the system required to specified a customer when a 
	delivery provider is specified. So, this feature save operator's time.

New: Externalization of custom reports. Corresponding links were added to menu bar.

New: Default custom report 1: Production and sales. Excel file with 3 sheets: sales, global consumption of materials,
	detailed consumption per product. Daily breakdown.

New: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION soberano."z-fn_Helper_closeAllClosedOrderProcessRuns"()
	
	This function closes all the process runs of closed orders. It could be used as part of an
	optimization where this function would be called from a periodic job (crontab or another one). 
	The rationale is closing runs upon collecting orders could be very slow (depending on the computer)
	due to inventory calculation an recalculation. So, a possibility
	is to disable this (by commenting these two lines
	
	PERFORM soberano."fn_Order_closeProcessRuns"(orderid, loginname) FROM
	soberano."Configuration" WHERE "This_has_UpdateInventoryOnOrderClosing";
	
	in the body of FUNCTION soberano."fn_Order_collect"(cashregister integer,
											orderid integer,
											lang character,
											currencies integer[],
											amounts numeric[],
											tip numeric,
											notes character varying,
											customer integer,
											loginname character varying))
											
New: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS metamodel."Vote_history". This table is for periodically backing up table 
	metamodel."Vote" aiming to keep it small for performance and, at the same time, preserve data for rule
	enforcing, analysis, 	and reporting. Otherwise, metamodel."Vote" could  eventually became huge, 
	depending on business activity.
	
New: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS soberano."StockChange_history". This table is for periodically backing up table 
	soberano."StockChange" aiming to keep it small for performance and, at the same time, preserve data for rule 
	enforcing, analysis, and reporting. Otherwise, metamodel."Vote" could  eventually became huge, depending on 
	business activity.

Fix: A target file's name resulting of shift closure exporting now contains that closure shift date.

Fix: Database function fn_ShiftClosure_getFullReport

Fix: Database function fn_ShiftClosure_getReport

Fix: In comboboxes to add items to an order, the height of comboitems were set to 20px for proper visualization
	in responsive mode.
	
Fix: In new_order.zul, the sizes of customer comboitems were set to 20px for proper visualization
	in responsive mode.
	
Fix: These zk style classes were override, for proper visualization of comboboxes to add items to an order in
	responsive mode:
	
		.undefined {
			transform: translate(0px, 0px) !important;
		}
		
		.z-combobox-content {
			height: auto !important;
		}
		
		div[id*="cave2"] {
			height: auto !important;
		}
