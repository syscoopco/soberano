v1.0.5 release

New: 
	
Fix: In process_runs.zul, final product processes were excluded, so there was no way to get the cost from UI.
	Fixed by changing plpgsql FUNCTION soberano."fn_Process_getAllToRun"(character varying).
	
Fix: Production line vauchers were printed even in cases they didn't change. This happened when grouped production
	allocations were enabled.
