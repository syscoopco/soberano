v2.0.4 candidate
New: Migration to ZK Framework 10.2.1.

New: Shift closure general report, full report, cash register report, and cost center report queries were updated (simplified).

New: Report exporting is externalized by means of zul component custom attributes (for report parameters) and spring beans for 
	retrieving data from database, and creating files in the target format (csv, xls, ...).

Fix: In shift closure reports, sales amounts didn't take into account surcharges. This was corrected.

Fix: Subprocesses were shown in shift closure reports. Corrected.

Fix: Errors in functions soberano."fn_Order_make"(orderid integer, itemid integer, description character varying, runs numeric, loginname character varying),
		and soberano."fn_Order_changeDeliveryProvider"(orderid integer, providerid integer, loginname character varying),
		caused bad calculation and presentation in tickets of reseller compensated prices. The right statement was:
	
	--set compensated prices
	UPDATE soberano."ProcessRunOutputHasPriceForOrder"

		SET "Price" = "Price" * (100  + deliveryProviderRate) / 100
			WHERE "ProcessRunHasProcessRunId" = processRunId;
			
	Other corrections in ticket soberano."fn_Order_getTicket"(orderid integer, receivedamount numeric, change numeric, lang character, loginname character varying)
	
	For example, when price compensation (due to resellers) is enabled, the shown delivery fee is based on the list prices (before compensation). That's
	the money to be given to the reseller, as commission over these prices (before applying compensation).
