v2.0.11 Candidate release

New: In order form (order.zul or ms_order.zul), now it's possible to order new rounds of an item from a current round
	of that item. It's just to push button decorated by "+", on the corresponding ordered item round tree item.

New: Cash drawer is opened after closing an order.

New: In cash register form, when the change is negative, the amount is shown and the background is colored in red. Before,
	it was shown amount 0 and kept the background color unchanged.

Fix: Upon business data cleaning request, remove stock changes and vote histories.

Fix: Disable pools in Spring beans org.springframework.ldap.core.support.LdapContextSource and  
	org.springframework.security.ldap.DefaultSpringSecurityContextSource. Enabling them caused
	users logged through network to be unable to login or unexpectedly logged out immediately
	after login. This reduces probability of that to happen.

Fix: Avoid to use bold fonts in printing. It had problems with legibility of numbers in receipts printed in thermal paper. 

Fix: Sending printer paper cutting command from TCPTOOL was disabled. Cutting must be controlled by means of the OS printer settings tool. 

Fix: In fast ordering window (based on product icons), some items were wrongly selected in the item-to-order autocompletion combobox.
	It was due to when pushing product button (icon), the combobox text was filled out only with the product name without the 
	corresponding inventory item code, so the ambiguity between comboitems upon selection.

Fix: Avoid division by zero. These lines were corrected:

	In FUNCTION soberano."fn_ProcessRun_close"(processrunid integer,

		Line SET "Value" = "Value" + outputsTotalValue * weighttoredistribute / producedoutputcount / 100
		
		was replaced by SET "Value" = "Value" + CASE WHEN producedoutputcount = 0 THEN 0
