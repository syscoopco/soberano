1.0.2

New: shift_closures.zul now shows canceled closures too. So, a new decision was added to check canceled shift closures 
	in table "metamodel"."ResponsibilityFilter"
	
New: A checker is authorized to record and cancel shift closures.

Fix: Auditor responsibility was able to record and cancel a shift closure. These rights were removed from table 
	"metamodel"."ResponsibilityFilter"

Minor correction: In the pl/pgsql function soberano."fn_Stock_recalculateInventoryFrom\"(startdatetime timestamp with time zone),
					now recalculation if made from a day before the occurrence of the operation that triggered the recalculation.
					This is to avoid missing stock change records during the recalculation.

Typo: User manual, page 102: “las existencia” replaced by “las existencias”.
