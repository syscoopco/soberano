v2.0.10beta La Lisa Edition

New: FUNCTION soberano."fn_Product_get"(productid character varying, loginname character varying).
	This is required by the order's form product barcode processing code. Noticed instead the product
	integer id, it takes the string inventory item id as parameter.

Fix: Removed EAN-8 barcodes processing.
