v2.0.5 release candidate

New: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION soberano."z-fn_Helper_closeAllClosedOrderProcessRuns"()
	
	This function closes all the process runs of closed orders. It could be used as part of an
	optimization where this function would be called from a periodic job (crontab or another one). 
	The rationale is closing runs upon collecting orders could be very slow (depending on the computer)
	due to inventory calculation an recalculation. So, a possibility
	is to disable this (by commenting these two lines
	
	PERFORM soberano."fn_Order_closeProcessRuns"(orderid, loginname) FROM
	soberano."Configuration" WHERE "This_has_UpdateInventoryOnOrderClosing";
	
	in the body of FUNCTION soberano."fn_Order_collect"(cashregister integer,
											orderid integer,
											lang character,
											currencies integer[],
											amounts numeric[],
											tip numeric,
											notes character varying,
											customer integer,
											loginname character varying))

Fix: A target file's name resulting of shift closure exporting now contains that closure shift date.

Fix: Database function fn_ShiftClosure_getFullReport

Fix: Database function fn_ShiftClosure_getReport
